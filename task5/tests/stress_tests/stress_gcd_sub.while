{- gcd by repeated subtraction: unbalance the input to show the performance
 e.g. 1 and 10000, this way will forces many subtractions up front 
 and generates a much heavier workload.-}
a := input;
b := input2;
while not [a=0] do
  if a >= b then
    a := a - b	-- with unbalance inputs this repeats many times
  else
    b := b - a

output := b
